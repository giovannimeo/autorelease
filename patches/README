This directory will contains directories per-branch which in turns
will contain patches as generated from:

git format-patch --stdout <version ranges> > <projectid>.git

so if we want to apply patches to controller.git on master before to attempt the
release we shall create the file "master/controller.git". This is useful
during test of the autorelease process for applying patches that may
block the release process otherwise.
