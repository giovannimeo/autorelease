This directory will contains patches as generated from:

git format-patch --stdout <version ranges> > <projectid>.git

so if we want to apply patches to controller.git before to attempt the
release we shall create the file "controller.git". This is useful
during test of the autorelease process for applying patches that may
block the release process otherwise.
